## Latest release

Latest release can be found [in Github Releases page](https://github.com/vcmi/vcmi/releases/latest). As of right now we plan to have major releases around 3 times per year. Daily builds are still available at [builds.vcmi.download](https://builds.vcmi.download/branch/develop/) but they are not guaranteed to be stable. So we encourage everybody to use them and report found bugs so that we can fix them.
Loading saves made with different major version of VCMI is usually **not** supported, so you may want to finish your ongoing games before updating.
Please see corresponding installation guide articles for details for your platform.
