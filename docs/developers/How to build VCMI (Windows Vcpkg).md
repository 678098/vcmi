# Prerequisites

-   Windows Vista or newer.
-   Microsoft Visual Studio
    [2017](https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/older-downloads/) or
    [2019](http://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/download-visual-studio-vs)
-   CI use VS2019, so you are going to have less problems with it.
-   Git or git GUI, for example, SourceTree
    [download](http://www.sourcetreeapp.com/download)
-   CMake [download](https://cmake.org/download/). During install after
    accepting license agreement make sure to check "Add CMake to the
    system PATH for all users".
-   To unpack pre-build Vcpkg:
    [7-zip](http://www.7-zip.org/download.html)
-   To create installer: [NSIS](http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Main_Page)

# Choose directory

Create a directory for VCMI development, eg. **C:\VCMI** We will call
this directory **%VCMI_DIR%**

**Warning!** Replace **%VCMI_DIR%** with path you chosen in following
commands of this instruction.

## How to choose good directory

It is recommended to avoid non-ascii characters in the path to your
working folders. The folder should not be write-protected by system.
Good location:

-   **C:\VCMI**

Bad locations:

-   **C:\Users\Micha≈Ç\VCMI** (non-ascii character)
-   **C:\Program Files (x86)\VCMI** (write protection)

# Install dependencies

You have two options: to use pre-built libraries or build your own. We
strongly recommend start with using pre-built ones.

## Option A. Use pre-built Vcpkg

So you decide to start using Vcpkg packages pre-built by VCMI team.

Package guaranteed to work since they tested with every commit by
[GitHub Actions](https://github.com/vcmi/vcmi/actions).

### Download and unpack archive

Archives are available from GitHub:
<https://github.com/vcmi/vcmi-deps-windows/releases>

Only download latest version available.

-   vcpkg-export-**x86**-windows-v140.7z to build for 32-bit no debug, 3
    times smaller file size
-   vcpkg-export-**x64**-windows-v140.7z to build for 64-bit no debug, 3
    times smaller file size
-   vcpkg-export-**x86**-windows-v140-debug.7z to build for 32-bit with
    debug configuration available
-   vcpkg-export-**x64**-windows-v140-debug.7z to build for 64-bit with
    debug configuration available

Extract archive by right clicking on it and choosing "7-zip -\> Extract
Here".

### Move dependencies to target directory

Once extracted "vcpkg" directory will appear with "installed" and
"scripts" inside it.

Move extracted "vcpkg" directory into your **%VCMI_DIR%**.

## Option B. Build Vcpkg on your own

Please be aware that if you're running 32-bit Windows version, then this
is impossible due to <https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg/issues/26036>

Be aware that building Vcpkg might take a lot of time depend on your CPU
model and 10-20GB of disk space.

### Create initial directory

### Clone vcpkg

1.  open SourceTree
2.  File -\> Clone
3.  select **<https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg/>** as source
4.  select **%VCMI_DIR%/vcpkg** as destination
5.  click **Clone**

From command line use:

    git clone https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg.git %VCMI_DIR%/vcpkg

### Build vcpkg

-   Run

<!-- -->

    %VCMI_DIR%/vcpkg/bootstrap-vcpkg.bat

### Build dependencies

-   For 32-bit build run:

<!-- -->

    %VCMI_DIR%/vcpkg/vcpkg.exe install tbb:x64-windows fuzzylite:x64-windows sdl2:x64-windows sdl2-image:x64-windows sdl2-ttf:x64-windows sdl2-mixer[mpg123]:x64-windows boost:x64-windows qt5-base:x64-windows ffmpeg:x64-windows luajit:x64-windows

-   For 64-bit build run

<!-- -->

    %VCMI_DIR%/vcpkg/vcpkg.exe install install tbb:x86-windows fuzzylite:x86-windows sdl2:x86-windows sdl2-image:x86-windows sdl2-ttf:x86-windows sdl2-mixer[mpg123]:x86-windows boost:x86-windows qt5-base:x86-windows ffmpeg:x86-windows luajit:x86-windows

For the list of the packages used you can also consult
[vcmi-deps-windows readme](https://github.com/vcmi/vcmi-deps-windows) in
case this article gets outdated a bit.

# Build VCMI

## Clone VCMI

1.  open SourceTree
2.  File -\> Clone
3.  select **<https://github.com/vcmi/vcmi/>** as source
4.  select **%VCMI_DIR%/source** as destination
5.  expand Advanced Options and change Checkout Branch to "develop"
6.  tick Recursive submodules
7.  click **Clone**

or From command line use:

    git clone --recursive https://github.com/vcmi/vcmi.git %VCMI_DIR%/source

## Generate solution for VCMI

1.  create **%VCMI_DIR%/build** folder
2.  open **%VCMI_DIR%/build** in command line:
    1.  Run Command Prompt or Power Shell.
    2.  Execute: cd %VCMI_DIR%/build
3.  execute one of following commands to generate project

**Visual Studio 2017 - 32-bit build**

    cmake %VCMI_DIR%/source -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=%VCMI_DIR%/vcpkg/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake -G "Visual Studio 15 2017"

**Visual Studio 2017 - 64-bit build**

    cmake %VCMI_DIR%/source -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=%VCMI_DIR%/vcpkg/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake -G "Visual Studio 15 2017 Win64"

**Visual Studio 2019 - 32-bit build**

    cmake %VCMI_DIR%/source -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=%VCMI_DIR%/vcpkg/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake -G "Visual Studio 16 2019" -A Win32

**Visual Studio 2019 - 64-bit build**

    cmake %VCMI_DIR%/source -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=%VCMI_DIR%/vcpkg/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake -G "Visual Studio 16 2019" -A x64

## Compile VCMI with Visual Studio

1.  open **%VCMI_DIR%/build/VCMI.sln** in Visual Studio
2.  select "Release" build type in combobox
3.  right click on **BUILD_ALL** project - build project. This BUILD_ALL
    project should be in "CMakePredefinedTargets" tree in Solution
    Explorer.
4.  grab VCMI in **%VCMI_DIR%/build/bin** folder!

## Compile VCMI from command line

**For release build**

    cmake --build %VCMI_DIR%/build --config Release

**For debug build**

    cmake --build %VCMI_DIR%/build --config Debug

Debug will be used by default even "--config" if not specified.

# Create VCMI installer (This step is not required for just building & development)

Make sure NSIS is installed to default directory or have registry entry
so CMake can find it.

After you build VCMI execute following commands from
**%VCMI_DIR%/build**.

### Execute following if you built for Release:

    cpack

### If you built for Debug:

    cpack -C Debug

# Troubleshooting and workarounds

Vcpkg might be very unstable due to limited popularity and fact of using
bleeding edge packages (such as most recent Boost). Using latest version
of dependencies could also expose both problems in VCMI code or library
interface changes that developers not checked yet. So if you're built
Vcpkg yourself and can't get it working please try to use binary
package.

Pre-built version we provide is always manually tested with all
supported versions of MSVC for both Release and Debug builds and all
known quirks are listed below.

### VCMI won't run since some library is missing

**If you open solution using vcmi.sln** Try to build INSTALL target and
see if its output works as expected. Copy missing libraries or even all
libraries from there to your build directory. Or run cpack and use
produced installer and see if you can get libs from there. cpack -V will
give more info. If cpack complains that it can not find dumpbin try
Visual Studio Command Prompt (special version of cmd provided with
Visual Studio with additional PATH) or modify PATH to have this tool
available. Another alternative if you use prebuilt vcpkg package is to
download latest msvc build, install it and copy missing/all libraries
from there.

### Debug build is very slow

Debug builds with MSVC are generally extremely slow since it's not just
VCMI binaries are built as debug, but every single dependency too and
this usually means no optimizations at all. Debug information that
available for release builds is often sufficient so just avoid full
debug builds unless absolutely necessary. Instead use RelWithDebInfo
configuration. Also Debug configuration might have some compilation
issues because it is not checked via CI for now.

### I got crash within library XYZ.dll

VCPKG generated projects quite often have both debug and regular libs
available to linker so it can select wrong lib. For stable
RelWithDebInfo build you may try to remove debug folder from
VCPKG/installed/x64-windows. Same is done on CI. Also it reduces package
size at least twice.

### Some outdated problems

All problems of such kind should be solved with proper cmake INSTALL
code.

**Build is successful but can not start new game**

Check that all non-VCMI dlls in AI and Scripting (vcmilua.dll and
vcmierm.dll) folders are also copied to the parent folder so that they
are available for vcmi_clent.exe. These are tbb.dll fuzzylite.dll
lua51.dll. Also there should be as well folder scripts (lua scripts for
ERM). If scripting folder is absent please build vcmiLua and vcmiErm
projects. There is no direct dependency between them and vcmi_client for
now (2021-08-28)
