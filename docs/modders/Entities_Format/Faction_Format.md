## Building node

``` javascript

	"upgrades" : "baseBuilding", // optional, which building can be upgraded by this one
	"requires" : [ "allOf", [ "mageGuild1" ], [ "tavern" ] ], // building requirements, H3-style. See below for full format.

Building requirements can be described using logical expressions:

``` javascript

        [ "tavern" ],
        [ "blacksmith" ]
    ]

```

## Structure node

``` javascript

	"animation" : "", // def file with animation
	"x" : 0,
	"y" : 0,
	"z" : 0, // used for blit order. Higher value places structure close to screen
	"border" : "", // selection highlight
