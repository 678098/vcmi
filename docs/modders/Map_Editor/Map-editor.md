# Compatibility questions

## Platform compatibility

vcmieditor is a cross-platform application, so in general can support all platforms, supported by VCMI.

However, currently it doesn't support mobile platforms.

## Engine compatibility

vcmieditor is independent application so potentially it can be installed just in the folder with existing stable vcmi. However, on the initial stages of development compatibility was not preserved because major changes were needed to introduce into vcmi library. So it's recommended to download full package to use editor.

## Map compatibility

vcmieditor haven't introduced any change into map format yet, so all maps made by vcmieditor can be easily played with any version of vcmi. At the same time, those maps can be open and read in the old map editor and vice verse - maps from old editor can be imported in the new editor. So, full compatibility is ensured here.

## Mod compatibilty

vcmieditor loads set of mods using exactly same mechanism as game uses and mod manipulations can be done using vcmilaucnher application, just enable or disable mods you want and open editor to use content from those mods. In regards on compatibility, of course you need to play maps with same set of mods as you used in the editor. Good part is that is maps don't use content from the mods (even mods were enabled), it can be played on vcmi without mods as well
