## Game options

#### How can I change screen resolution?

Start any scenario, open System Options dialog and click "High" button.

In case only 800x600 is available, close VCMI, download this
[file](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/fwor43x5xrgzx6q/AABpTFqGK7Q9almbyr3hp9jma/mods/vcmi.zip)
which contains the “bonusIcons” and “extraResolutions” repertories.
Unzip, and place them in XXX (Windows), YYY (Android), ZZZ (Mac) or
~/.local/share/vcmi/Mods (Linux). Then start any scenario, open System
Options dialog and voilà, other resolutions than 800x600 are availables.

Note that you need to restart VCMI for the change to take effect.

#### How to turn off creature queue panel in battles?

Hotkey to switch this panel is "Q"

#### Can I turn off some WoG features that I don't like?

Yes. Take a look on config/defaultMods.json file and edit it to your
liking.

Note to Linux users: this file can be found in vcmi data directory (run
vcmiclient -v to see path). It can be copied into ~/.vcmi/config/ to
avoid editing file usually owned by root.
