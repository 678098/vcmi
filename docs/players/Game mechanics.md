# List of bugs fixed in VCMI

These bugs were present in original Shadow of Death game, however the
team decided to fix them to bring back desired behaviour.

# List of game mechanics changes

Some of H3 mechanics can't be straight considered as bug, but default
VCMI behaviour is different:

-   Dwellings. Remain creatures are accumulated instead of reset each
    week. Can be disabled using DWELLINGS_ACCUMULATE_CREATURES.
-   Pathfinding. Hero can't grab artifact while flying when all tiles
    around it are guarded without triggering attack from guard. Original
    behavior can be re-enabled using "originalMovementRules" pathfinder
    option.
-   Battles. Hero that won battle, but only have temporary summoned
    creatures alive going to appear in tavern like if he retreated. Can
    be disabled using WINNING_HERO_WITH_NO_TROOPS_RETREATS.
-   Battles. Spells from artifacts like AOTD are autocasted on beginning
    of the battle, not beginning of turn. Task on mantis:
    [1](https://bugs.vcmi.eu/view.php?id=1347)
-   Objects. Black market changes artifacts every month like town
    artifact merchants do. Can be disabled using
    BLACK_MARKET_MONTHLY_ARTIFACTS_CHANGE.
-   Spells. Dimension Door spell doesn't allow to teleport to unexplored
    tiles. Task on mantis to track this:
    [2](https://bugs.vcmi.eu/view.php?id=2751).
