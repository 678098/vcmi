# Troubleshooting / well known issues

## The game crashes on start

**Please double check that you copied original SoD/Complete game files
into your Android Device**  

## I installed google play version, but have a problem while installing daily builds

**Solution:** Uninstall google play version first, before installing
daily build version.

## I installed play version, but the screen is flashing / blank on its edges

**Solution:** Should be fixed since VCMI 1.3

## The game always starts in 800x600 resolution, cannot effectively change it, also there is a lot of blank space on my widescreen device

**Solution:** Should be fixed since VCMI 1.3 onwards.

If you use version 1.2 or older - please download "VCMI-extras" mod from
VCMI Launcher. Resolution setting 1024x600 is better than original
800x600 for widescreen mobile phones.
