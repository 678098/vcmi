# Step 1: Download and install VCMI

Install one of following into new folder, same as when installing new
game:

-   Latest release (recommended):
    <https://github.com/vcmi/vcmi/releases/latest>
-   Daily builds (unstable):
    <https://builds.vcmi.download/branch/develop/Windows/>
-   Please report about problems on GitHub: [Bug
    Tracker](https://github.com/vcmi/vcmi/issues)

# Step 2: Installing Heroes III data files

**Since VCMI 1.2 you can skip this step, just run VCMI launcher and it
will help you with importing H3 data. For older releases you can follow
this step.**

-   Install Heroes III from disk or using GOG installer.

<!-- -->

-   Copy "Data", "Maps" and "Mp3" from Heroes III to:

<!-- -->

    %USERPROFILE%\Documents\My Games\vcmi\

Create this folder if it doesnt exist yet

# Step 3: (for release 1.0.0 and above) connect to the mod repository

-   If that's your first installation, connection to the mod repository
    will be configured automatically, you'll see mods available to
    install from VCMI launcher
    -   We recommend you to install VCMI extras to support various
        helpful UI tweaks and (before 1.3) support for different screen
        resolutions

# Step 3: (for old builds 0.99 and earlier) download and copy and enable Essential Package

-   Skip this step if you installed 1.0.0 or latest daily build
-   For some technical reasons it wasn't included in game installation
    package for legacy versions and needs to be downloaded and activated
    seperately
-   Download "VCMI essential files mods" from here
    <https://wiki.vcmi.eu/Mod_list#Utilities>
-   After unpacking, copy folder Mods to your main VCMI directory
-   When launching game, please enable "VCMI essential files" as well as
    its sub-elements: Andruids Bonus Icons, Bonus Icons, Spell Immunity
    bonus icons, Extra resolutions and Default templates.
