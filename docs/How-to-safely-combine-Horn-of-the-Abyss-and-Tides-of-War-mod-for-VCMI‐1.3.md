Because Horn of the Abyss and Tides of War expansions change Conflux townscreen (and some other minor aspects) it is not trivial task to get all features at once without incompatibilities and visual bugs. This article describes what to enable and/or disable in laucher to play maps safely.

1. If you want to play only Horn of the Abyss mod without Tides of War (then you won't get alternate creatures in OH3 towns) - it'e easy task. You must disable Tides of War mod in the launcher.

2. If you want to play only Tides of War mod without Horn of the Abyss (then you won't get Cove town and many other features) - you must disable Horn of the Abyss mod in the launcher **and** Hota balance compatibility patch must be **disabled!**
